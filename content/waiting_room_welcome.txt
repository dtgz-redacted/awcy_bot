Hi @{username}. Welcome to the Are We Cool Yet? Waiting Room. This is where we get to know prospective member and gauge their skill set, interests and how well they'll mesh with the team as a whole. After some discussion and a few questions, a vote by OG members will take place that may let you all into the dev team.
When you feel you're ready to join the dev team, print our official AWCY? calibration oven and then ping one of us to take you to #theCastingCouch and we'll interview you thoroughly. It may take 30 mins to an hour to complete the whole process.
